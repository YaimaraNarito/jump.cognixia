Thus far we have learned about

* DevOps and SRE concepts
* Worked with git bash and GitHub
* Basic commands for git bash terminal learned so far include but are not limited to:
    git push
    git pull
    git add .
    git commit -m "message here"
    git branch
    git switch
    git fetch
    git status
    git branch -a
    git branch -r
    git diff origin/main
    git merge origin/main
    git pull -u origin branch-name
    git push --set-upstream origin new-branch

* Learned about local and remote repositories and their differences.

    Also, how the two can be synced from the local machine with git bash, or remotely, through GitHub.
    We can clone an existing repo and build upon it, or create a new one from scratch.

* Other topics include:

    Commands
    Branch creation
    Text file creation and addition to the branch
    Upstream
    Issues creation

* Jenkins

    • Best practices:
		○ Automate deployment
		○ Proper monitoring system
		○ Redundancy is necessary -- Different environments: Dev, UAT, Prod
		○ Infrastructure as a code (SRE job)
                ○ Create environment on demand
    • Concepts:
                ○ Continuous Integration
		○ Continuous Delivery
		○ Continuous Deployment

    • Jenkins Installation and setup
    • Creation of new projects in Jenkins
    • Integrate Git repo with Jenkins              
    • Scheduling crontab
