Thus far we have learned about

DevOps and SRE concepts

Worked with git bash and GitHub
Basic commands for git bash terminal learned so far include but are not limited to:
git push
git pull
git add .
git commit -m "message here"
git branch
git switch
git fetch
git status
git branch -a
git branch -r
git diff origin/main
git merge origin/main
git pull -u origin branch-name
git push --set-upstream origin new-branch

Learned about local and remote repositories and their differences.

Also, how the two can be synced from the local machine with git bash, or remotely, through GitHub.
We can clone an existing repo and build upon it, or create a new one from scratch.
Other topics include commands, branch creation, text file creation and addition to the branch, upstream, issues creation
