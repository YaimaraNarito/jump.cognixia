Thus far we have learned about local and remote repositories and their differences.
Also, how the two can be synced from the local machine with git bash, or remotely, through GitHub.
We can clone an existing repo and build upon it, or create a new one from scratch.
Other topics include commands, branch creation, text file creation and addition to the branch, upstream

Basic commands for git bash terminal learned so far include but are not limited to:
  git push
  git pull
  git add .
  git commit -m "message here"
  git branch <branch name>
  git switch <branch name>
  git fetch
  git status
  git branch -a
  git branch -r
  git diff origin/main
  git merge origin/main
  git pull -u origin branch0name
	git push --set-upstream origin new-branch

SO FAR i HAVE NOT HAD MANY HICKUPS
